# General Notes

Topic: Duality

## Concept and backstory

Matter has been separated into dark an light by a Katastrofik event. No more colour exists in the world. The Light and Dark particles can not exist at the same time.
The player takes control of the light particle to retrieve all the matter particles to restore balance and unify the universe.

## Style

Top down view where player navigates a maze/dungeon. The ability to switch between Dark and Light.

## Dark

The default tone for the game. You are a target for negative energy. Negative particles move towards you and will break you down and remove you from existence.

## Light

When in "Light" the player pushes away negative energy. But, the light can only last for n\* seconds. There after, there is a cool down of n seconds. Once you return to dark mode, the enemies will "Haste" for n seconds towards you. So the "Light" can not be over used.

> \* `n` Still to be determined

## Beat the level

Collect the matter fragment and reach the exit without dying.
